The original `build.gradle` file may contain some hidden errors or misconfigurations that need deeper investigation. The solution focuses on enhanced logging and debugging to identify the root cause.

To improve debugging:
1. **Enable full debug output:** Modify your `gradle.properties` file (if it doesn't already exist, create it in the android/ directory) and add the line `org.gradle.daemon=true` to enable the Gradle daemon for faster builds and better error reporting.  Also consider increasing the logging verbosity of the Android build system.
2. **Clean and rebuild:** Try `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android` to clean your build directory and force a fresh build. This sometimes resolves transient issues.
3. **Inspect the full log:** The error message often provides a pointer to a specific file or line. Search the build output for any other clues, such as warnings or detailed error messages further up in the log. This might reveal the exact resource causing the problem.
4. **Check for resource conflicts:** Examine your `res` directory for any files with conflicting names or IDs.  Ensure your images are correctly sized and formatted.  Carefully review your XML layouts for any errors.
5. **Use a debugger:** The Android Studio debugger can help identify the exact point of failure during resource linking. It enables stepping through the build process and inspecting the state of the resources.

Example of improved error tracing with more verbose logging in your `gradle.properties`:
```gradle
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
org.gradle.daemon=true
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
```

Note: The exact solution depends on the nature of the error. The steps mentioned above provide a systematic approach to resolve this type of problem.
